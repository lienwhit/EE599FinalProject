Ideas:
1. Cinematic Sound Design Survey Experiment
a. Give users a movie scene of a similar (thriller, action, horror, disney, etc.)
b. Choose instruments to use for different sections: 
i. Percussion, Lead, Accompienant, Bass, SFX
c. 3 sound choices for each
d. Architecture: based on visual choose certain auditory designs
e. Flask/Python create interface

Requirements:
? We are looking for a specific project topic (not: "we will do a project on room acoustics"!).
? Details of the approach you will take (simulation? what tools? listening evaluations? what methods? etc.)
? A list of related work from the literature (this is often forgotten and leads to many misunderstandings).  For example, "authors X, Y did this and we plan to use their results in this way..."
